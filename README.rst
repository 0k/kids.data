``kids.txt`` is a Python library providing helpers to manage text.
It's part of 'Kids' (for Keep It Dead Simple) library.

It is, for now, a very humble package.


Features
========

using ``kids.txt``:

- You'll have a ``indent`` command in python 2.7. I know it was included in python 3.3.
- You'll be able to ``wrap`` text keeping the paragraph separated.
- have a ``ucfirst`` function.


Compatibility
=============

This code is tested for compatibility with python 2.7 and python >= 3 .
